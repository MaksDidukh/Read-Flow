Hello everyone. I didn't think about this project for long. The idea came to me when I was scrolling through TikTok. I decided to turn it all into a living idea.
I didn't write it entirely myself. GPT did this work.
Thank you user for reading this message I hope this code will make reading your favorite book much more interesting, exciting and faster.
Good luck!

To open this project, simply download the HTML file and open it on your phone or computer, download the book and enjoy.
