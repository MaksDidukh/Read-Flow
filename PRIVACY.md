# Privacy Policy for ReadFlowBlocks

**Last Updated: April 26, 2025**

ReadFlowBlocks is an open-source web application for reading text files. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 1. Data We Collect
- **Uploaded Files**: You may upload files (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .html, .epub, .rtf) for reading. These files are processed entirely in your browser and are not sent to any server.
- **Reading Progress**: We store your reading progress (current word index) in your browser's `localStorage`.

## 2. How We Use Data
- Uploaded files are processed locally to display text in the application.
- Reading progress is stored to allow you to resume reading from the same position.

## 3. Third-Party Services
ReadFlowBlocks uses the following third-party libraries, loaded via CDNs:
- `pdf.js` (Apache 2.0)
- `mammoth.js` (BSD-2-Clause)
- `epubjs` (BSD-2-Clause)
- `rtf.js` (MIT)
These CDNs (`unpkg.com`, `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`) may collect metadata, such as your IP address or browser information. To avoid this, you can host the libraries locally (see [Contributing](README.md#contributing)).

## 4. Your Rights
You can clear all stored data by resetting the reading progress in the application, which clears `localStorage`.
